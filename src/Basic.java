Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
LeetCode-style sliding window problem.
Input: "abcabcbb" â†’ Output: 3

Find Duplicate in an Array
Return any duplicate element in a given array of integers.



ðŸ”¹ Linked Lists & Trees
Reverse a Linked List
Classic question. Expect recursive and iterative versions.

Detect Cycle in Linked List
Use Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection Algorithm.

Lowest Common Ancestor in a Binary Tree
Asked to test recursion and tree understanding.

ðŸ”¹ Search & Sort
Binary Search with Condition
Search an element in a rotated sorted array.
Input: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0 â†’ Output: 4

Custom Sort Function
Sort a string based on the custom order of another string.

ðŸ”¹ Matrix & 2D Arrays
Rotate Matrix 90 Degrees Clockwise
In-place matrix rotation.

Search in 2D Matrix
Binary search approach on a sorted matrix.

ðŸ”¹ Miscellaneous/Advanced
LRU Cache Design
Implement an LRU Cache with get() and put() in O(1) time using LinkedHashMap or Deque + HashMap.

Multithreading Problem (for senior SDET)
Implement a class where three threads print "A", "B", and "C" in sequence repeatedly.

Producer-Consumer Problem
Use Java threads and synchronization to simulate this.

ðŸ”¹ API-related Coding
Mock an API Call Response Parser
Given a JSON string, parse and validate required fields.

Chained API Output Combination
Combine results from multiple simulated REST calls using test stubs.

ðŸ§  Behavioral Coding Follow-Ups
After solving a problem:

"How would you test this?"

"What edge cases should be handled?"

"How would you write unit tests for this?"

"How do you optimize this code for time/space?"

ðŸ“Œ Preparation Strategy
Practice on LeetCode: focus on easy to medium difficulty, especially string, array, and sliding window problems.

Know how to write JUnit/TestNG tests for your code.

Practice REST API integration problems with real response parsing.

Prepare a few object-oriented design questions (e.g., Logger, Parking Lot) as Apple values modular design.
